rearchitect runner worker code, and also make it so that we can send a bundle without backrun tx
also publish it normally

TODO set nonce programmatically 
TODO init nonce 
TODO update nonce for dead workers

  // TODO info of {}
  // TODO obvious reverts, but where? check demo-research.ts  
    // liquidate seize too much in reverrt message 
  // TODO: add users to this list, delete them fom the db, and never fetch them again

key is compromised, its saved in the .env in the git commit history
and also on my computer 
DO NOT MAKE REPO PUBLIC or share computer files

switch from alchemy to geth node 

Compound -> AAve -> multichain (buy ssds, minimize resource usage, vpc)

2. make some vms as my fallback using blocknative by modiyfing the runner
3. start docker and bot daemon automatically on startup or disable automatic updates


timestamps seem to be too close: the miner starts mining just a second after i receive the tx,
so theres no time for the liq to get computed and included in the same block 
thus i allow the arb to get included in the next block sans the backrun txs
TODO still begs the question of how i can see the backrun longer before the miner starts mining
